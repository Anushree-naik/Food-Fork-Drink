React Native application to search the nearby restaurants. 

## Aim of the project: 

- To make a cross platform mobile application, making use of React framework in Javascript. Since React-Native was a new technology for me to get hands on, my aim for was to learn as much as I can, in the span of 8 weeks or so. 

## What is this project?

- In this project, I have levegraged the Yelp API as a primary database for the application. The best part of React Native framework is you can make multiple resuable components inside your project directory which can save writing a lot of redundent code. 

- This application consist of 5 screens and 4 reusable components. The goal of this application is to search restaurants nearby you according to the query you enter in the search bar. I have also made a protocol of `Saved Items` feature inside this application where you can press `Like` button and that ID is saved inside `Saved Items` screen. 

## How to run this project on your device?

## Challenges that I faced during development of this project:

1. For some reason, my application could not be connected to the JSON server that I was planning on integrating as a second database. 

2. My future goal is to understand the process where I can use multiple APIs and cross reference them inside the application to make use of all the available data.
